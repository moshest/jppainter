# [JP-Painter](http://moshest.github.io/jppainter/)

We got the inspiration to create this project from the works of Jackson Pollock. This project illustrates that we can create art by using a given data set and some randomization.

See examples and more info here <http://moshest.github.io/jppainter/>!
